# Crowd Management System

This project was designed as a crowd managment system, which helps to distribute crowd amoung service providers and decrease waiting time in line. In this project we are using huging face api to identify head of people in waiting line and with a simple KNN model we are estimating their waiting time, by averaging their waiting time as a live data, we can identify an index which shows how crowded a place is, then, accourding to locaion of a person, and crowdness of the place, we are suggesting the best place.
